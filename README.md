# Warchall Challenge
 This repository contains a report on challenges in ![wechall.net](https://www.wechall.net) concerning some basics on hacking.

## Trining: Warchall - The Beginning
 The objectif is to find one solution for one level, the instructions for this challenge are in the following link : [!https://www.wechall.net/challenge/warchall/begins/index.php](https://www.wechall.net/challenge/warchall/begins/index.php).
 It is necessary to connect to an ssh server with the command : 
    ssh -p 19198 username@warchall.net

#### The list of level
 *[level0](level0.md)
 *[level1](level1.md)
 *[level2](level2.md)
 *[level3](level3.md)
 *[level4](level4.md)
 *[level5](level5.md)
 *[level10](level10.md)

 ## Training: Get Sourced
  In this challenge, The solution is hidden in the code source. The link is : [https://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/get_sourced/index.php](https://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/get_sourced/index.php).

 ## Training: Binary Encoding
  This challenge show how to converse a number int in a binary code and ask how to coverse another number.
